Hi Sarvnaz!

I think there has been a misunderstanding about what was required for this assignment. You only had to produce something that used alerts and prompts. What you've done here is way beyond what you needed to do, but it works amazingly well!

Even though what you did was a lot more complex than what I was expecting you've achieved everything you needed to do. Well done

Välgodkänt, congratulations!
